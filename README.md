## How to use CheatGPT

### File explorer

Files can be created using the menu on the top. They store the link of a chatGPT conversation. Right click on it to edit the link, delete or rename the file. Double click to open the conversation. 

You can also create folders that contain files and folders just like a classic file explorer. Right click on a folder to rename or delete it. Double click to open the folder.

Change the view style on the top right button to switch from grid to list display and vice versa.

The left arrow button lets you go back a folder.

### Prompt generator

The prompt generator lets you generate prompts to get better answers to your chatGPT requests. Let's take an example.
Suppose I am trying to write a linkedin post about blockchain. I could simply ask : "Write me a linkedin post about blockchain". But the result might be basic and not that interesting. 

Using my prompt generator you define: 
<ul>
<li>The role chatGPT must play : a linkedin influencer</li>
<li>His experience in that domain : lots of content on linkedin specially about blockchain technologies and wrote complete posts to explain technical subjects</li>
<li>His task for you : write a complete linkedin post about blockchain using typical linkedin post format</li>
</ul>
This will generate 

-> "Ignore all instructions before this. You are a linkedin influencer since 20 years. You did lots of content on linkedin specially about blockchain technologies and wrote complete posts to explain technical subjects. Your task is now to write a complete linkedin post about blockchain using typical linkedin post format."

Results will be more interesting, chatGPT even gave me some hashtags at the end ! Use this prompt each time you ask something. Personally it's now necessary before asking any code questions.
